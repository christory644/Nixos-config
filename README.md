### NixOS Configuration for my personal systems

This repository contains my NixOS configuration files. There are many out there like it, but these ones are mine. Heavily influenced by ZaneyOS, VimJoyer, and iynaix.

This repo is not meant to be a turnkey solution to copying my setup or learning Nix. I've tried to use simple Nix practices wherever possible, but if you wish to copy this from me, you'll have to learn at least the basics of Nix, NixOS, Home Manager, Flakes, etc

I don't claim to be an expert at Nix or NixOS, I am sure there are certianly improvements that could be made. Feel free to suggest them, but please do not be offended if I don't integrate them. I value having my configs work in a way I fully understand over having it be optimal.
